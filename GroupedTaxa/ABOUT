Phylogenetic analysis of grouped taxa:
--the library involves a modified distance method for grouped taxonomical units (there is preliminary knowledge that some nodes should be clustered together)
--unfortunately due some technical issues I lost access to the current version of the library
--therefore some classes implementations are missing and in some modules, more or less, only the scaffold is presented
--the method is described in the paper [1] in my CV.
